	// When present, will force Minecraft to operate as if "fabulous" mode was selected.
	// Normally this means translucent geometry will be drawn to different framebuffers
	// and mc and mods expect five additional framebuffers will be available:
	// 		mc_entity				- item entities
	// 		mc_particles
	// 		mc_weather
	//    mc_clouds
	//    mc_translucent  - terrain
	//
	// The main purpose of this setting is compatibility with mods that draw directly.
	// These extra framebuffers which are visible to mods and some of them
	// will target a specific buffer when fabulous mode is active.  If you want mods
	// to draw direct translucency to separate buffers, configure this.  If you want them to
	// target the default framebuffer set this false.
  //
  // The actual target for managed draws will be controlled by the stage configuration.
	// These mappings will *only* affect unmanaged draws that directly target one of these buffers.
	//
	// The structure of these should match the default framebuffer and be compatible
	// with direct draws.

	// Canvas does *not* automatically do the necessary passes for fabulous mode
	// to compsite the transparency layers. That must be configured in the pipeline
	// - this offers maximum flexiblity for shader devs.
